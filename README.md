# My Personal Project

## A Student-Dating App


- **What will the application do?**

The application will store information about students personal attributes.
Information will contain - Name and description about the student.

Possible Features include adding student profiles to the database, removing students from the database, loading 
previous files from the database and saving files to the database.  

- **Who will use it?**

The application is for students - to date, to make new friends, or to explore students as a whole.
 
- **Why is this project of interest to you?**

I flew into Vancouver recently - and everything to me is new, surreal and strange. And so, I want to make new friends, 
go out on dates and get to know people in general.


## User Stories

- *As a user, I should be able to add new profiles.*
- *As a user, I should be able to print existing profiles.*
- *As a user, I should be able to save my work to a file.*
- *As a user, I should be able to load my work from a file.*

Implemented the first option: "Test and design a class in your model package that is robust."

Class: StudentProfile ; Method: getName() throws an Exception.

Class: SwingClass     ; Method: refreshStudentList() handles the Exception.
