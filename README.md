# My Personal Project

## A Student-Dating App


- **What will the application do?**

The application will store information about students personal attributes.
Information will contain - Name, Age, Gender, Major, sexual preference and a one line description about the student.

Possible Features include adding student profiles to the database, removing students from the database, updating 
gender, major and sexual preferences. 

The main feature of the application will be to recommend students based on the users preferences 
(sexuality, age, major).

- **Who will use it?**

The application is for students - to date, to make new friends, or to explore students as a whole.
 
- **Why is this project of interest to you?**

I flew into Vancouver recently - and everything to me is new, surreal and strange. And so, I want to make new friends, 
go out on dates and get to know people in general.
